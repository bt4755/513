- Today I researched approximate inference techniques. I have found at least 5 inference techniques I wish to consider assessing for my project. Gibbs sampling, MAP, 2 Markov Chain methods i.e Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and its predeccessor Metropolis Hastings, but these are not novel techniques. Im still looking for novel techniques to incorporate in my research. Might test a total of 7 approximation techniques.

- Ive decided to incorporate creation of my own baseyian model into my project. 

- May choose 3 different datasets for and create 3 different models as I also want to incorporate how a change in data type might affect the inference technique. I should also incorporate a pre made model.

- Also spent the day gathering references.

- * Set task for tomorrow :
    Begin Beysian model construction and write up intro
